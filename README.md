This project is a Front End Website (Survey Form).

This is a sample project created for the purpose of learning and demonstration of Microsoft Azure Skills during the Future Ready Talent Program. Therefore this project is not intended for comercial deployment.

This is a simple Survey Form Website. It is a responsive static website that allows users to enter their choices and options to get benfited.

Generally this survey form is created using HTML. The survey form is created using simple HTML commands in an interactive design. A repository is created in the name of the Static Web App and the respective website files are uploaded to it. Since this is simple design, it doesnot require any additional images to be uploaded in the repository. After logging in to the Azure Portal, a Static Web App is created with a new resource group. It is directly deployed on the Github repository and the workflow is updated. A Read Me file is created and the Project Demo URL appears automatically on the repository.
